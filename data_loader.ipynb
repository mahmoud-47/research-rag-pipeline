Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU.

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\n6'),\n",

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'),\n",

In the context in which most industries focus on digitalization and automation of \\nproduction processes and on developing new products, the car manufacturing industry is \\nadvancing significantly. The automotive industry together with the IT field, are at an advanced \\nstage in terms of the structure of autonomous vehicles, developing new technologies. The \\nobjective of this paper is to present the current state of technology regarding autonomous \\nvehicles. Aspects regarding the devices and technologies used in the construction of these \\nvehicles are approached, but there is also information regarding the way of classifying them \\naccording to the driver’s assistance level. In addition, some information about the evolution of \\nautomated vehicle development is presented. \\n1.  Introduction \\nNowadays, when the world is in constant motion, the number of own means of transport (especially \\ncars) or public transport is growing very fast, both due to the needs and due to the current trend. \\n”According to statistics, there are 1.1 billion vehicles, but it is expected to increase to 2 billion in the \\nnext 10-15 years” [3]. With the increase in the number of land transport, one thing that has been \\nobserved for several years, is the overcrowding of cities. Overcrowding is characterized by the lack of \\nparking spaces and by the traffic jams present throughout the day in the most interesting areas of a \\nmetropolis or even small towns. All this leads to the loss of significant amount of time during the day, \\nspent behind the wheel of the vehicle or in means of transport (busses, trolleybuses, etc.), which has \\ndirect effects on the state of fatigue and implicitly of the driver’s attention. In addition, traffic jams \\nhave an adverse effect on the environment, because significant amounts of harmful substances are \\ngenerated during operation, even when waiting at a traffic light. All these factors mentioned above, \\noften lead to the generation of accidents, which can be material or in the worst case can result in injury \\nor even death of some people. As an alternative for the future, regarding the elimination of the \\ndisadvantages of conventional traffic, the autonomous (or automated) vehicle brings a series of \\nfacilities in order to facilitate urban and interurban mobility. These facilities range from driver \\nassistance systems to complex system (hardware and software) capable of activities such as: \\nperception, decision and reaction, with the role of streamlining road traffic through better of the \\ndriving process a vehicle. \\nVehicles equipped with various driving assistance systems are no longer a novelty, they have been \\non market for several years. These systems have an important contribution to reducing the number of \\nroad accidents. According to recent data, approximately 1,2 million people die worldwide due to road \\naccidents, [3].'),\n",

Evolution \\nAround the 1920s, in the USA, due to the large number of accidents caused by the carelessness of \\ndrivers, the development of driverless vehicles was discussed. Thus, in August 1921, the first vehicle \\nwithout driver on board was presented, which was radio-controlled from an army vehicle located 30m \\nbehind it. It can be said that this is the pioneer of cars without a driver. The development of this \\nprototype being closely linked to the technology owned by the army, [3].  \\nOf course, after this presentation, other vehicles appeared either based on the same technology or \\non something more innovative: \\n \\n- in 1925, the electronic engineer Francis P. Houdina, equipped an ordinary vehicle with the \\nequipment necessary to perform driving maneuvers, being controlled remotely by radio waves, [1], \\n[2].  \\n \\n- in 1939 during the exhibition “Futurama”, an innovative concept propelled by magnetic \\nfield generated by the electric circuit incorporated in the running track was presented. It was made by \\nindustrial designer Norman Bel Geddes with the support of General Motors, [2].  \\n \\n- in 1958 – the first ”automatically guided automobile” completed a one-mile test at the GM \\nTechnical Centre (Michigan).It was a Chevrolet that had  two electronic sensors mounted in the front \\nthat followed a cable stretched along the track, thus, controlling the position of the steering wheel and \\nimplicitly the steering wheels, [1].  \\n \\n- in the 1980s, research on autonomous vehicles took off in many countries, both \\nacademically and industrially, [1].  \\n \\n- in 1994 in the PROMETHEUS-Project, Ernst Dickman’s team developed with the help of \\nMercedes Benz W140 – a robotic vehicle, which was able to travel on congested highways around \\nParis at speeds of up to 130 Km/h, [1].  \\nThus, manufacturers companies such as: Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive \\nSystem, Autoliv, Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Hyundai Motor Company, Volvo, Tesla Motors, \\nPeugeot, Navya, Google, BMW, Local Motors, Easy Mile, etc., have developed and are still \\ndeveloping new prototypes of autonomous vehicles. Due to this technological boom, the legislative \\nframework on the testing and circulation of autonomous/automated/robotic vehicles in many countries \\nneeds to be rethought. In this sense, in 2013 the UK government allowed their testing on public roads, \\nafter that, in 2014, the French Government adopted the same legislative measures, followed by other \\nEuropean countries and not only( in 2015, 5 US states allow AV testing on public roads: Nevada, \\nFlorida, California, Virginia, Michigan), [4].  \\n3.  Classification \\nAccording to the J3016 standard published by SAE International, regarding the degree of automation \\nof the driving function, there are 6 levels, from SAE Level 0 (without automation) to SAE Level \\n5(fully autonomous vehicle). It can be said that this ranking was made on the one hand based on the \\nvolume of activities in which the driver is involved, and on the other hand based on the performance \\nand equipment of the vehicle. In addition, this standard (SAE Standard J3016, 2016) corresponds to \\nthe levels defined by the Federal Highway Research Institute of Germany (BASt - Bundesanstalt für \\nStrassenwesen), but also to some extent with those formulated by the National Administration for \\nTraffic and Safety (NHTSA), [4].  \\nSAE Level 0 (No Automation): this is where most current vehicles fall. In this case, as it is known, \\nthe driver is responsible for all actions,(acceleration/braking, maintaining direction, changing \\ndirection, using lights and signals, avoidance of obstacles, etc.), but in some situations, the vehicle \\nmay be equipped with warning  systems (object warning in the blind spot of the mirror, collision \\nwarning).'),\n",

The essential devices that are part \\nof an autonomous vehicle, and that help it to move safely are presented in this section. However, it \\ndoes not mean that all autonomous vehicles have the same type of sensors or technology, these aspects \\nbeing characteristic of every manufacturer or developer. \\n \\nFigure 2. The sensor and device system of an autonomous vehicle [5] \\n \\nLIDAR (Light detection and ranging) - is a device for measuring distance based on laser beam \\ntechnology, transmitting light waves (beams) to a target (obstacle), then analyses the reflected light. It \\ncan detect static or dynamic objects (vehicles, pedestrian, cyclists, buildings, etc.) in the vicinity of the \\nvehicle. It is capable to create a virtual map (2D or 3D) with these obstacles. It is usually mounted on \\nthe roof of the vehicle so that it can have a range of 360 degrees, [2], [4], [6], [9].  \\nRADAR (Radar Detection and Ranging). Radar sensors that equip autonomous vehicles can be \\ngrouped in two broad categories: long range radar (LRR) or mid-range radar (MRR). These sensors \\nare mounted on the front, rear and sometimes on the side corners of the vehicles. Radar systems \\noperate on the basis of electromagnetic waves and are used to detect various obstacles or oncoming \\nvehicles. They can also be used to determine the speeds of oncoming vehicles, or for the correct \\noperation of some equipment: adaptive cruise control (ACC), impact warning, for self-parking, etc.,  \\n[2], [4]. Most often autonomous vehicles have both LRR and MRR radar systems. These systems can \\nhave a range of up to about 200m with a dispersion of up to 40° (or even 75°- in this case the range \\ndecreases considerably), [2], [4], [7].  \\nGNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) include all satellite navigation systems, whether we are \\ntalking about regional or global systems [8]. GPS (Global Positioning System) the most widely used,'),\n",

The system (GPS) helps to keep the \\nvehicle on the desired route with a fairly high accuracy (approximately 30 cm), this being possible \\nalso due to the other systems in the endowment of the AV with which it collaborates, [4], [8].  \\nUltrasonic sensors: these sensors detect objects in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, being \\nmounted on almost all sides of the vehicle. They are used in parking assistance application, already \\nhaving a wide spread on the market [4], [10].  \\nInertial measurement unit (IMU): an inertial measurement unit is a device that can measure the \\nlinear and angular motion of the vehicle, as well as the gravitational forces acting on it, using \\naccelerometers and gyroscopes. For high position accuracy, the output data from the IMU are \\ncombined with the data obtained from GPS system [2], [4].  \\nThermal cameras: with their ability to detect heat, they provide a wider range of action than \\nheadlights, so they can detect in a timely manner the presence of various obstacles (pedestrians, \\nanimals, other vehicles, etc.), on the road or near it. They have the ability to detect even in more \\ndifficult conditions of movement: at night, through smoke, on the strong brightness of the sun, etc. \\nVideo Cameras: the video cameras that come with autonomous vehicles are high-resolution stereo \\ncameras, positioned at the front next to the rear-view mirror. Their role is to constantly monitor the \\nroad, and to transmit the information (images) for their processing in order to recognize the traffic \\nsigns, pedestrian, crossings, traffic lights, cyclists, etc. Some cameras also have the ability to estimate \\nthe distance to detect objects. Often autonomous vehicles have video cameras in the back, or mounted \\non their roof, to be able to see a range of 360°, [1], [2], [3], [4].  \\nADAS (Advanced driver assistance system) - is one of the most widespread and developed \\napplications in the field of autonomous vehicles, being implemented even in vehicles of the middle \\nand lower class of the market. The advanced ADAS functions used in autonomous driving involve a \\nseries of interconnected systems and sensors, thus making it possible to move the autonomous vehicle \\nsafely [10]. In other words, ADAS is a piece of equipment that includes both the software solution and \\nhardware part. It is able to carry out the driving process safely without the intervention of the driver, \\n[2].  \\n5.  How it works \\nIf we were wondering how we could use an autonomous vehicle to make a trip, compared to a classic \\nvehicle, this is relatively simple: the driver/user/passenger must enter the desired destination, and the \\nvehicle chooses the route or it can be chosen by the driver/ the occupant. This activity is similar to \\nsetting a destination on a regular navigation system/device. After setting the destination and the route, \\nthe vehicle takes over, [4].  \\nJust as people must have certain abilities to be able to drive a vehicle, so must it be in the case of \\nautonomous vehicles. But in their case, the senses and abilities are taken over by a system of software \\nand hardware devices. The main component of this system is artificial Intelligence through algorithms. \\nThrough these algorithms, information is processed and compared, and finally decisions are made \\nregarding the driving commands (acceleration, breaking, steering, etc.) of the vehicle in order to avoid \\nany possible incident. \\nThe system that coordinates an autonomous vehicle can easily be likened to a child’s brain and \\nsenses, because it is based on approximately the same learning processes (stimulus-perception-\\nprocessing-classification/comparison-decision making-action). Both, the system and the child need to \\nbe initiated in any activity. And with the accumulation of new knowledge, they will be able to better \\nface new challenges in life (in the case of child) or in traffic (in case of the vehicle). \\nIn order to be able to cope in real traffic conditions, the system that ensures the coordination of the \\nvehicle must have a series of data that will represent the database with which it will be able to \\ncompare the different situations during the travel. In addition to these data, during the trip the vehicle \\nalso records data in order to increase the database, for a better management of the following situations.'),\n",

This function is intended in particular for travel on the motorway or in stop-\\nand-go traffic jams, thus facilitating the reduction of driver stress in the situations mentioned above. \\nWith the help of this function the number of accidents can be reduced, at the same time improving the \\ntraffic flow. Activation of the function (transfer of commands) must be performed in a safe manner, \\n[1], [11].  \\nFull automation using driver for extended availability: can be considered a higher version of the \\n“interstate pilot” function, mentioned above. By transferring the driving functions to the automatic \\nsystem, the driver becomes a passenger, being able to release the steering wheel and pedals, but \\nhis/her absence is not allowed. By means of this function the vehicle can move in almost any situation, \\nas long as the movement area is not restricted from a legal point of view, regarding the movement of \\nvehicles equipped with autonomous driving systems, [1], [11].  \\nVehicle on demand: through this concept and technology, the availability of vehicle in (almost) any \\nlocation, at the request of an applicant, is possible. This solution is suitable for both passenger and \\nfreight transport. By replacing the human operator with an autonomous (automated) driver, the time \\nspent in traffic would be considerably reduced, because the system does not require breaks for rest, \\nbeing available 24 hours a day. This concept is closest to what an autonomous vehicle (SAE Level 5) \\nmeans in the future, [1], [11].  \\n7.  Conclusion \\nIt is noted that the development of driver assistance systems as well as attempts to make various \\nprototypes of automated/autonomous vehicles has as a starting point the minimization of the number \\nof road accidents (driver and passenger safety, goods safety, and other road users). \\nIn the last 15 years, the technology has developed at a fairly fast pace. The autonomous vehicle and \\nits development bringing together companies from different fields: companies developing navigation \\nsystem, camera devices, software and hardware solutions, up to the major automotive concerns. But an \\nextremely important factor in the development of this industry is the legislative framework. This is the \\nreason why most often the developers of autonomous vehicles have to meet with the governments of \\ncountries of the world, in order to regulate the use of these vehicles in the public space. \\nThe Internet of things (IoT), the giant network of connected devices and users, which collect and \\nshare information about the environment where they are, is in continuous development. The evolution \\nof this technology but also of the road telematics (long-range information transfer) made possible the \\ndeveloping of vehicles with a certain level of driving autonomy and increased the safety of using this \\ntype of vehicles. Through continuous developing of Internet of Things technology and its integration \\ninto automotive filed, the way of interacting between user and vehicle or/and between vehicle and \\nanother devices (especially road infrastructure) will be change completely. \\nIn order to increase safety, it will be necessary to intensify the communication protocols between \\nvehicles (V2V) but also the communication with the infrastructure (V2I). Thus, the current \\n(conventional) infrastructure will have to be improved so that it can meet the requirements of \\nautonomous vehicles. And as a considerable improvement in the exchange of information, \\ncommunication with everything (V2X) – any other device- will further facilitate the movement of \\nautonomous vehicles because they will have enough information to meet the challenges. But all this is \\npossible only with the help of artificial intelligence that requires continuous improvement, so that in \\nthe coming years to reach fully autonomous vehicles (SAE-LEVEL 5). \\nReferences \\n[1] \\nMaurer M, Gerdes J C., Lenz B, and Winner H 2015 Autonomous Driving \\n[2] \\nIclodean C, Cordos N, and Varga B O 2020 Autonomous Shuttle Bus for Public Transportation:'),\n",

One of the researchers was the\\nBriton Sir Ronald Ross. He left for India with a personal mission to prove transmission via\\ninsects. In 1897, after three years of hard work, he demonstrated parasites in mosquitoes\\nwhich had bitten patients. Later he also demonstrated transmission of avian malaria via\\nmosquitoes. He was able to describe the complete development of the parasite in the\\nmosquito and also demonstrated that transmission took place via the bite of the mosquito\\n(and not via the presence of dead mosquitoes in drinking water, as his mentor Patrick\\nManson had initially thought).\\nLife Cycle\\nAfter the cause and transmission of malaria became known, it was logical to assume that\\nthe parasites inoculated via a mosquito bite would directly penetrate red blood cells. This\\nwrong idea was proposed in 1903 by Fritz Schaudinn, a distinguished German microscopist.\\nIt was based on faulty observation and due to his authority, it entered some textbooks. It\\nwas known that when blood from a patient with active malaria was inoculated into a healthy\\nvolunteer, the volunteer would develop malaria and would become infectious nearly\\ninstantaneously. However, when a volunteer was inoculated via a mosquito bite, the blood\\nwas not infective for 6 days (in case of P. falciparum) to 9 days (P. vivax).\\nWhy? This was a vexing problem which took decades to answer. It was by very careful\\nanimal experiments with P. cynomolgi, a primate malaria species, that the puzzle was\\nsolved. Shortt and Garnham collected a large number of infected mosquitoes, mashed them\\nto pulp and injected the lot (including sporozoites) into monkeys. After waiting a period, they\\nkilled the animals and searched the various organs and tissues. The parasites (with a\\ndiﬀerent shape) were found in the liver. They had to support their hypothesis of the\\nexistence of a pre-erythrocyte stage with a species of human malaria. They used P. vivax\\nand a human volunteer. This man was inoculated IV with sporozoites isolated from 200\\nmosquito salivary glands. A week later, the volunteer was operated on and a piece of liver\\ntissue was obtained. The parasites were present in the liver. A year later they obtained a\\nstrain of P. falciparum, infected 770 mosquitoes and inoculated another human volunteer.\\nAbout 6 days later a liver biopsy was taken and again the parasite was found.'),\n",

To induce repeated spikes of high fever in patients with\\nprogressive paralysis, he inoculated them with blood from patients who were suﬀering from\\ntertian malaria (Plasmodium vivax). Although not without risk, this treatment proved to be very\\nsuccessful.\\nLife cycle\\nWhen a mosquito lands on the skin, it attempts to pierce a small blood vessel with its proboscis in\\norder to suck blood. To prevent the blood from coagulating the mosquito ﬁrst injects some saliva.\\nBesides vasodilating agents this saliva contains anticoagulants. However, the saliva may also contain\\nmicro-organisms. When a human is bitten by an Anopheles infected with malaria, parasites\\n(sporozoites) [Gr. sporos = seed] are introduced into the human body. On average 10-20 sporozoites\\nare injected per bite, although this number can be higher, e.g. 100.\\nA certain protein of the parasite, (the circumsporozoite protein, CSP), plays an important role in the\\npenetration of the sporozoite into a liver cell (cf. Mosquirix vaccine). Sporozoites reproduce asexually\\nin liver cells, by schizogony [Gr. schizo = split, divided]. This is called exo-erythrocytic or pre-\\nerythrocytic reproduction. The form of the parasite produced in this way is called a liver schizont. The\\nmultinuclear schizont splits into many thousands of small oﬀspring (merozoites) [Gr. meros = part].\\nEvery successful sporozoite can produce some 20,000 merozoites.\\nAfter some time the infected liver cells burst and the merozoites enter the blood stream. While the\\nparasites are reproducing in the liver, there are no symptoms. Neither the sporozoites, nor the liver\\nforms are sensitive to most of the drugs used in malaria prophylaxis (atovaquone/proguanil is an\\nexception). The minimal required time from infection to the appearance of the ﬁrst merozoites, is the\\nprepatent period. The incubation period is somewhat long because signs and symptoms do not\\nappear until the parasitaemia is suﬃciently advanced. Of note, merozoites in blood are usually too\\nsmall to be seen by microscopy.\\nIn the case of P. vivax and P. ovale only some of the infected liver cells burst. The parasites in the\\nliver cells which do not burst (hypnozoites) [Gr. hypnos = sleep] may remain viable for years and are\\nresponsible for new attacks of the disease if reactivated. The trigger which reactivates the\\nhypnozoites is not known. The existence of hypnozoites in P. vivax was only formally demonstrated in'),\n",

Reactivation of these “sleeping” forms explains delayed\\nexacerbations of the disease after treatment with chloroquine and other antimalarial drugs. They kill\\nthe blood forms, but not the liver forms. Hypnozoites are not present in P. falciparum and probably\\nnot in P. malariae (although this is controversial). This is important for treatment because hypnozoites\\nare not sensitive to chloroquine, quinine, meﬂoquine or artemisinin. Accidental inoculation with\\ninfected blood (blood containing trophozoites) may lead to infection, e.g. transfusion malaria or\\nmalaria via shared contaminated syringes by drug users. Since the infection in these cases is not\\ntransmitted by sporozoites, there are no liver forms. Liver forms are also absent in congenital malaria.\\nThis is important for treatment (no primaquine for congenital malaria with P. vivax or P. ovale). The\\nchronic nature of infections with P. malariae is traditionally explained by assuming that the parasite\\ncan induce a very low parasitaemia (or hidden erythocytic schizontes) for many years, which is below\\nthe detection threshold of normal diagnostic methods.\\nIn the red blood cell the parasite feeds on haemoglobin. The form of the parasite when present in the\\nred blood cell is now known as a trophozoite (Gr. trophe = nutrition). The young parasite possesses a\\ndigestive vacuole with lysosomal enzymes. This vacuole contains proteinases (plasmepsin and\\nfalcipain). The vacuole can be clearly seen in a blood smear and explains the ring shape of the young\\nparasite. The breakdown of haemoglobin results in an iron-containing pigment: hemozoin. The\\nvacuole disappears as the parasite becomes older. The trophozoites will once more reproduce\\nasexually and lead to the formation of a multinuclear parasite (schizont). The latter divides to form\\nmerozoites. Each schizont produces 8 to 24 merozoites, depending on the species, within a time span\\nof 48 hours (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale), 72 hours (P. malariae) or 24 hours (P. knowlesi). The\\ninfected red blood cells burst after a while so that once more merozoites appear in the blood from\\nwhere they will penetrate new erythrocytes within a few seconds. This bursting (lysis) of the red blood\\ncells is accompanied by a bout of fever. If the development is synchronous (all parasites being at the\\nsame stage of development) the fever will follow a typical pattern (see below). This is, however,\\nunusual: asynchrony is more common than synchrony, especially early in infections. The development\\nfrom merozoite to schizont takes place in the peripheral blood and all stages can be observed. In P.\\nfalciparum usually only very young forms (ring forms) can be observed in the peripheral blood\\nbecause older parasites (and schizonts) adhere to the endothelium of blood vessels in deep organs\\n(e.g. the brain).\\nAfter a few days some of the merozoites transform into male or female gametocytes. These are\\nnecessary for sexual reproduction of the parasite (which only occurs in the mosquito). Gametocytes\\nare responsible for transmitting the disease but do not themselves cause symptoms. Adult P.\\nfalciparum gametocytes are not sensitive to chloroquine and quinine, while those of P. vivax, P. ovale\\nand P. malariae are sensitive. This means that following adequate treatment of P. falciparum there'),\n",

The\\nparasite’s LDH is clearly diﬀerent from that of humans and forms the basis of a diagnostic test (see\\nbelow).\\nGeographical distribution\\nMany lay people regard malaria as a purely tropical disease. However, the distribution of malaria used\\nto be world-wide. Today, it still occurs in some 100 countries. The situation varies from region to\\nregion. Until 1938 there was still P. vivax malaria (“polderkoorts”) in Belgium, and in the Netherlands\\nas late as 1958, although there was an unexplained (possibly autochthonous) case of P. malariae\\ninfection in a child in Zeeland in 1969. The WHO declared the Netherlands oﬃcially malaria-free only\\nin 1970. It is chieﬂy the pollution of surface waters which makes reproduction of Anopheles\\nmosquitoes diﬃcult.\\nYet some Anopheles persist and can transmit malaria. Anopheles atroparvus is able to transmit\\nPlasmodium vivax malaria but cannot transmit Plasmodium falciparum. Anopheles plumbeus can\\ntransmit tropical falciparum malaria. In the last century there were important changes in the lifestyle\\nof humans, resulting in less human/mosquito contact. Eﬀective therapy was available. All these\\nfactors mean that malaria has disappeared in Northwest Europe. Cases in Western countries are\\ngenerally dealt with swiftly and satisfactorily and one person with malaria very rarely leads to the\\ninfection of others. Chronic large scale reintroduction of the disease in Europe is thus improbable,\\nalthough with the combination of the current economic crisis with its plummeting health budgets, the\\nmassive inﬂux of tropical migrants refugees and global climate change, makes this possibility more\\nreal at present than in the last decades of the 20th Century.

Stable malaria means\\nthat the clinical disease is characterized by preferentially aﬀecting children and achieving a protective\\n“immunity” in adults. Stability does not mean that there can be no variation in transmission. In some\\nregions seasonal malaria occurs. In other areas there is unstable malaria: transmission diﬀers greatly\\nfrom year to year and occasionally epidemics occur. Then the disease also occurs in older persons.\\nThis is important in many respects; as irregular control of malaria may lead to changes in the immune\\nstatus of the population. Sometimes malaria may appear again in a region after a long absence. For\\nexample: in 1972 the disease was eradicated in South Korea following an intensive eradication\\ncampaign with case detection and vector control. In 1993 one case of P. vivax was observed. There\\nthen followed 22 cases in 1994, in 1995 there were 107 cases, 356 in 1996 and more than 1600 in\\n1997. In 1995 all cases were still limited to the border area with North Korea, but in 1996 there was\\nalso transmission outside the demilitarized zone. After entomological surveys had shown that\\nAnopheles sinensis was the chief vector, measures were taken to control the disease.\\nVector, Anopheles mosquitoes'),\n",

The details are complex. Anopheles gambiae prefers to land on\\nthe feet, while A. atroparvus prefers to bite the face.\\nVector control\\nMalaria vector control is primarily based on the use of insecticides. Appropriate monitoring of\\nvector resistance to insecticides is an integral component of planning and evaluation of insecticide\\nuses in malaria control programmes. Pyrethroids and DDT, two important insecticides used for\\nvector control, block the nerve-impulse conduction by preventing a sodium channel from closing\\nafter an action potential. An important mechanism that confers resistance to pyrethroids and DDT,\\nknown as knockdown resistance or kdr, was ﬁrst described in the houseﬂy Musca domestica. It has\\nbeen reported that a single mutation in the sodium channel sequence is the molecular basis of kdr\\nin Musca domestica. The gene has also been characterized for Anopheles gambiae. PCR tests have\\nbeen developed for the detection of the kdr-mutation in A. gambiae.\\nPhysiopathology\\nThe incubation period may be short (minimum 7-9 days for P. falciparum) to very long (several years\\nfor P. ovale). In falciparum malaria the parasitaemia can be very high: up to 80% of erythrocytes may\\ncontain parasites, but even 5% is enough to result in severe disease. These situations may be life-\\nthreatening. The other malaria parasites produce much lower parasitaemia (especially P. ovale). They\\ndo cause severe illness but are rarely life-threatening. P. knowlesi infections mimics severe P.\\nmalariae infections.\\nThe rupture of the red blood cells (haemolysis) is accompanied by fever, muscle pain and general\\nmalaise. Massive haemolysis may cause kidney failure. Parasitized red blood cells are removed by the\\nspleen. Splenomegaly will result. Anaemia occurs due to the destruction of erythrocytes, suppression\\nof the bone marrow and excess activity of the enlarged spleen (hypersplenism). In severe falciparum\\nmalaria, there is activation of blood coagulation system along with thrombocytopenia, even before\\nwidespread DIC and coagulation failure occur. In falciparum malaria there will often be a drop in\\nglycaemia that can be corrected by administration of glucose.\\nThe details of how cerebral malaria happens, are not clear at present, and various researchers have\\ndiﬀerent opinions. More than 100 years ago, the Italian pathologists Bignami and Marchiafava\\nreported on the sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in the brains of people who died of\\ncerebral malaria.

These consist, among other things, of a histidine-rich protein, P. falciparum\\nerythrocyte membrane protein 1 and riﬁns. Riﬁns are clonally variant proteins encoded by rif genes\\n(“repetitive interspersed family”) and are expressed at late ring or early trophozoite stage on the\\ninfected red cell surface. Their high copy number, sequence variability, and red cell surface location\\nindicate an important role in host-parasite interaction. The knobs have an overall negative charge,\\nallowing non-speciﬁc attraction to positive endothelial ligands, but speciﬁc molecular adhesion also\\nplay a part. With these knobs the infected cells cling to the walls of the capillaries and to the vascular\\nendothelium of the post-capillary venules in the brain. The low local O2 pressure and high CO2\\npressure are optimal for further maturation of the parasite. Infected red blood cells are less easily\\ndistorted and more rigid than normal erythrocytes. This impedes the blood ﬂow, which can lead to\\ncerebral malaria. Other organs may also be aﬀected for example the placenta and the intestines\\n(resulting in abdominal pain and diarrhoea). Red blood cells which contain schizonts of P. malariae,\\nalso develop knobs on their membranes, but these cells do not adhere to the vascular endothelium.\\nWhen post mortem cerebral sequestration was compared with the peripheral parasitaemia, there\\nwere about 26 times more infected red blood cells in the brain microvasculature than in the\\nperipheral blood if there were free-mixing. More blood vessels in the cortex and cerebellum than in\\nthe brain stem are aﬀected. Some researchers found more sequestration in white matter than in\\ncortex. Coma requires sequestration, but sequestration itself is not enough to provoke cerebral\\nmalaria. The rapid reversible nature of cerebral malaria led to the hypothesis that soluble neuroactive\\nmediators might play a role in the pathogenesis possibly involving reversible disturbances of the\\nblood brain barrier and biochemical disruption of normal metabolism.\\nThere are two groups of parasites in P. falciparum infections: (1) the young forms in the peripheral\\nblood which can easily be observed in a thin blood smear and (2) the mature group which is attached\\nto small blood vessels and which cannot be seen. Falciparum schizonts are rarely found in peripheral\\nblood but these are important for the development of cerebral malaria. The whole mechanism of\\ncerebral malaria has not to date been fully explained. As well as the attachment of parasitized red\\nblood cells to the vessel walls (cytoadherence) other mechanisms possibly also play a part. Normal\\nred blood cells sometimes attach to parasitized cells, which impairs the microcirculation. All kinds of\\nreleased chemical substances (cytokines, oxygen radicals, etc.) may also play a part. Cytokines such\\nas tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a) increase the expression of receptor molecules on the endothelium\\nand will contribute to the cytoadherence and ﬂow obstruction which characterize falciparum malaria.\\nThis mechanism is similar to the release of TNF-a by endotoxins in Gram-negative septicaemia.\\nIncreased brain volume was seen in children who died from cerebral malaria but was uncommon in\\nthose who did not die from the disease; this suggests that raised intracranial pressure may contribute\\nto a fatal outcome.'),\n",

The same advantage probably applies to persons deﬁcient in G6PD. This may explain why these\\ntwo conditions are so common in Africa. In Papua New Guinea ovalocytosis is common. These red\\nblood cells have an oval shape and cannot be penetrated by P. falciparum parasites. Heterozygotes\\nare thus protected against P. falciparum (homozygosity is not compatible with life).\\nIn West Africa, haemoglobin C is rather frequent.

On the surface of the\\ninfected red blood cell a certain protein is expressed: the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein\\n1 (PfEMP-1). The parasite can make many variants of this protein.

These proteins are thought to be the major virulence factor found on the surface of infected\\nred blood cells, directly contributing to the pathogenic nature of the infection and placing these genes\\nat the centre of a disease responsible for several million deaths in developing countries. Although\\nthere are many var gene copies, only a single var gene is expressed at any given moment (i.e. there\\nis mutually exclusive expression).

The severity of the thrombocytopenia correlates with the parasitaemia and the\\nclinical severity of infection.\\nLAST UPDATED BY SUSAN DIERICKX ON JANUARY 22ND, 2025\\nMalaria – Clinical aspects\\nClassic acute uncomplicated attack\\nMost clinical episodes of malaria are characterized by fever with aspeciﬁc symptoms. Certainly, in\\nchildren the presentation can be very misleading. Any fever should bring the possibility of malaria to\\nmind. There is a danger, however, that every fever episode may be regarded as malaria and other\\nimportant diagnoses are then likely to be missed.\\nP. falciparum: typical incubation time: 7 to 30 days. If a person is taking preventive antimalarials and\\nif the parasite is partially resistant, there may be temporary suppression of a malaria attack. The\\nfever is generally irregular. If the attack is not treated, after a few weeks a regular fever pattern will\\ndevelop with peaks every 2 days (tertian malaria, so called because the fever reappears on the third\\nday, reckoning the day of the paroxysm as the ﬁrst. This is rare in everyday clinical practice). At the\\nbeginning of the attack the symptoms are similar to inﬂuenza: general malaise, tiredness, muscle\\npain, headache but in general without respiratory tract problems or running nose. These symptoms\\nare non- speciﬁc. After a while the muscle pain and headache become worse. Sometimes there is also\\nabdominal pain and diarrhoea. Rarely there is a classic attack: this lasts for approximately 12 hours\\nand occurs every 48 hours. At ﬁrst cold shivers with high fever occur, followed by an intense feeling of\\nheat and fever, leading to a sweating stage with a drop in fever. Most falciparum attacks do not follow\\nthis classic pattern. Therefore what is referred to as a classic attack is paradoxically not the general\\nrule.\\nP. vivax and P. ovale: the incubation time is a few weeks to years. The awakening of dormant\\nparasites in the liver (hypnozoites) explains the potential for late relapses. The fever is sometimes\\nregular (every 48 hours) especially in cases of recrudescence (tertian malaria). In 1922 P. vivax was'),\n",

It was thought that the bacterium which causes syphilis\\nhad little resistance to heat, so the high fever would kill the bacteria (Treponema pallidum).\\nP. malariae: the incubation time is 3 weeks to many years. The very late attacks are probably not due\\nto awakened hypnozoites (to date these have never been detected) but due to the activation of blood\\nparasites which are present at a very low concentration. Fever peaks may occur every 72 hours\\n(quartan malaria).\\nP. knowlesi is a monkey parasite which can be misidentiﬁed as P. falciparum in the early ring stage\\nand as P. malariae in the older stages. It has the shortest asexual life cycle of all i.e. 24h. The\\nprepatent period is 9-12 days. At present, no hypnozoites have been found. PCR is needed to ﬁrmly\\nidentify this species.\\nMixed infections: mixed infections do occur, but for reasons which are unclear they are much less\\ncommon than would be expected based on the prevalence of the individual species. Underreporting\\nmay play a part, but this is probably a real phenomenon (partial cross-immunity to heterologous\\nspecies? biological interference?).\\nNatural course of malaria in the autochthonous\\npopulation\\nChildren are very susceptible to infection. The highest mortality is found in children below the age of 5\\nyears. Gradually, after repeated infections, a partial immunity develops in those who survive. There is\\na high degree of tolerance to the infection in adults, provided they live in a stable malaria region. This\\nsemi-immunity (or “premunition”) is maintained by repeated infections and mild latent infections. It\\ndisappears after approximately 6 to 24 months if there is no further infection (e.g. a stay in a non-\\nmalaria region).\\nThis partial immunity is reduced during pregnancy. A pregnant woman is at increased risk of\\nhypoglycaemia and cerebral malaria. Malaria is an important cause of severe (sometimes spectacular)\\nanaemia in the mother, low birth weight, premature birth, abortion and increased perinatal death.\\nChondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid, both present in abundance around the syncytiotrophoblasts\\nof the placenta, are mucopolysaccharides (glycosamine glycanes) which act as receptors for red blood\\ncells infected with P. falciparum.

There are several problems and the\\nquestion has still not been fully resolved. The demonstration of malaria parasites in the blood is\\nessential but insuﬃcient in itself. Most cases are accompanied by thrombocytopenia and normal white\\ncount. Many people will develop an acquired immunity after several years of exposure and may\\nharbour parasites without exhibiting symptoms. The degree of parasitaemia may help, but there is no\\nabsolute criterion (the higher the parasitaemia, the more chance that malaria is in fact the diagnosis).\\nThere are patients with malaria for whom the thick smear is negative (luckily this is rare in a good\\nlaboratory). There are no pathognomonic clinical signs. An accurate diagnosis is becoming more and\\nmore important, in view of the increasing resistance of P. falciparum and the higher price of modern\\ncombinationtreatments.\\nClinical aspects\\nNo single clinical sign allows the diagnosis of malaria. Most cases are accompanied by\\nthrombocytopenia, a normal white count and a positive parasitaemia. Yet malaria must always be\\nconsidered in cases of fever in the tropics. Since the symptoms can be quite diverse, a clinical\\ndiagnosis is unreliable and the diagnosis should be based on identiﬁcation of the parasite. Microscopic\\nconﬁrmation of the diagnosis is often not possible in many regions and situations. It is of the greatest\\nimportance that other important diagnoses are ruled out before instituting a blind anti-malaria\\ntherapy. All too often fever is considered as malaria without considering alternative diagnoses. This\\ntendency is reﬂected in the quote: “if you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a'),\n",

When such people develop another infection their symptoms are often attributed to\\nthe malaria parasites in their blood, although these are not responsible.

Where there is any clinical suspicion it is best to\\nrepeat the test 12h later.\\nMicroscopy\\nA thick smear concentrates the parasites 10 to 25 times. It is rather more diﬃcult to interpret than a\\nthin smear preparation and often does not permit species identiﬁcation. A thick smear contains no\\nintact red blood cells (haemolysis due to the distilled water used in the staining). If a thick smear is\\npositive, a thin smear should be examined.\\nParasitaemia\\nThe parasitic density can also be roughly determined in a thick smear, by counting the number of\\nparasites per 200 leukocytes and multiplying this by 30. It is assumed that on average there are\\n6000 leukocytes per µl blood and that there is one leukocyte per 500 red blood cells. For example:\\n5 parasites per leukocyte (1000 parasites for every 200 leukocytes) corresponds to a density of\\n30,000 parasites per µl. Roughly 30,000 parasites per µl corresponds to a parasitaemia of 1% (5\\nparasites per 500 RBC’s): a moderately anaemic person.\\nIf the thick smear is found to be negative in a reliable laboratory and if there is strong suspicion of\\nmalaria, the test is repeated every 12 hours for 48 hours. One great disadvantage of the thick smear\\nmethod is that reliable technical expertise is needed which should be monitored (e.g. quality control).\\nThe argument that a lab technician has carried out the test for years and thus has plenty of\\nexperience is absolutely no guarantee of quality or reliability. The test also requires plenty of time if\\nthe parasitaemia is low, or before a negative result can be concluded.\\nA thin blood ﬁlm has many advantages:\\nit demonstrates the species present'),\n",

They are easy to use, provide results rapidly and require\\nno speciﬁc training and equipment. Reported sensitivities vary between diﬀerent RDT products but\\nare generally good for Plasmodium falciparum, with rapid tests based on the recognition of P.\\nfalciparum antigen histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) scoring slightly better than those which\\nrecognize P. falciparum–lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Sensitivity is lower for Plasmodium vivax (66\\n– 88%) and usually poor for Plasmodium ovale (55 – 85%) and Plasmodium malariae (21 – 45%). Rapid\\ndiagnostic tests have some limitations. The test strips are susceptible to heat and humidity. A positive\\nresult can be obtained after correct treatment, when there are no more parasites visible in the thick\\nblood smear. This is due to persistence of the PfHRP2 antigen (up to several weeks) after successful\\ntreatment. The pLDH based tests have the advantage of turning negative sooner after parasite\\nclearance (several days).

Treatment with quinine is unpleasant (bitter taste, cinchonism) and poor compliance\\nafter the acute phase is common.\\nTreatment regimens\\nThe basic regimen is 10 mg salt/kg, every 8 hours, orally or slow IV. Currently, a loading dose of 20\\nmg/kg IV over 4 to 8 hours is universally recommended for the ﬁrst administration (followed by 10\\nmg/kg every 8 hours). This should be continued for at least 4 days, preferably 7 to 10 days (if used in\\nmonotherapy). This is an unpleasant treatment. Because there is still a risk of relapse if quinine is\\nused in monotherapy even for > 7 days, another product is generally combined with it, e.g.\\ntetracycline or clindamycin. This allows also to shorten the quinine administration to 4-5 days.\\nSometimes treatment with Fansidar® is given after a few days, which shortens the treatment period,\\nbut only in regions where this drug is still suﬃciently eﬀective. If a patient vomits within an hour after\\nswallowing the medication, the whole dose should be repeated. If vomiting occurs longer than one\\nhour after ingestion, no new dose is necessary. In case of repeated vomiting IV administration is\\nrequired.\\nSide eﬀects of quinine\\nQuinine is a substance with highly irritating properties (also for the gastric mucosa: nausea is not\\nuncommon). Capsules are therefore best taken after a meal. Quinine increases the secretion of insulin\\nfrom the pancreas, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Quinine allergy is not common. What is\\ncommon is a range of side eﬀects such as tinnitus, temporary deafness for high frequencies,\\nheadache, nausea and palpitations. These toxic phenomena are known as cinchonism: quinine was\\nﬁrst isolated from the bark of the cinchona tree. This reduces the patient’s compliance.\\nQuinine increases irritability of the pregnant uterus. In case of need one must not hesitate to use\\nquinine in a pregnant woman with malaria (malaria itself can lead to abortion, preterm labour or\\ndeath in utero). To prevent an impending premature labour, a tocolytic agent can be given such as\\nthe beta 2-mimetic ritodrine, fenoterol or salbutamol. The calcium antagonist nifedipine is as eﬀective\\na tocolyticum as the beta-mimetics. Prolongation of the PR, QRS and QT intervals may occur during\\nthe use of quinine (as with quinidine). If the patient has atrial ﬁbrillation, conversion to sinus rhythm\\nmay occur with possibly arterial embolic complications. Atrial ﬁbrillation which has already been\\npresent for more than 48 hours is a contra-indication for quinine.

Overdose may also lead\\nto blindness via a direct toxic eﬀect on the retina and possibly also due to spasms of the retinal blood\\nvessels and subsequent retinal ischemia.\\nQuinine and Gin Tonic\\nUnlike the majority of other bitter products which occur naturally, the bitter taste of quinine is\\nshort-acting with no annoying after-taste. It is therefore used as a ﬂavouring to produce tonic\\nwater. The British colonialists in India often drank gin and tonic. The present-day tonic water\\ncontains approximately 15 mg per litre, however, only enough to give a bitter taste. Copious\\ndrinking of gin and tonic in order to prevent malaria, is thus only an excuse for drinking gin.\\nWhy is quinine resistance still rare?\\nThe product has been used for more than 360 years. This is in stark contrast to the resistance to\\nother malaria drugs or antibiotic resistance in bacteria where the “useful life” of a product is\\nmeasured in years or a few decades. The concept of a standard dose was only developed in the\\ntwentieth century. Earlier the duration of treatment and the dosage were left to the discretion of\\nthe doctor. This together with the fact that the concentrations of alkaloids varied greatly from plant\\nto plant and that quinine was never pure, meant that malaria was treated with a therapy which\\nmust have produced the most varied blood levels. Yet no wide spread quinine resistance has been\\nreported. The answer to the question why there is virtually no quinine resistance, could be very\\nimportant. Is the target molecule of quinine so special that mutation is not possible? It would then\\nbe very helpful to know this target. It could also be that there is quinine resistance, but that it was\\nnot, and has not been recognized. However, this is doubtful. Is it that the present recommended\\ndose is much higher than that which was formerly necessary? Is it the fact that “quinine” is\\nactually a mixture of various active products, which prevents resistance developing? Resistance to\\ncombined therapy requires multiple, simultaneous mutations which is less readily achieved than\\nthat to single products. It is possible that quinine has not previously been used at levels which\\ncreate suﬃcient evolutionary pressure. The majority of malaria cases in Europe and America were\\nP. vivax infections. Even in British India, P. vivax represented the lion’s share of infections. In P.\\nfalciparum endemic regions, only a few fortunate people were able to take quinine and then only\\nwhen they had to (because of unpleasant side eﬀects). Few used quinine as a prophylactic agent'),\n",

This resistance spread progressively and is now a signiﬁcant problem in most continents. There\\nare three grades of chloroquine resistance (RI, RII, RIII). In RI the parasitaemia after therapy is so low\\nthat it falls below the detection threshold, to rise above it again within 28 days. In RII the\\nparasitaemia is reduced by at least 75 %, but the parasites remain detectable in the peripheral blood\\nthroughout the treatment. In RIII chloroquine has no eﬀect on the parasitaemia.\\nIn 1991 chloroquine-resistant P. vivax strains were discovered in Papua New Guinea. In 2006, already\\n65% of the Papuan P. vivax strains were chloroquine resistant. P. vivax chloroquine resistance in other\\nareas, such as Indonesia, India, Brazil, Guyana is spreading. Chloroquine is not the ﬁrst-choice\\ntreatment any more for P. vivax in Indonesia and neighbouring islands. To date resistance to\\nchloroquine in P.ovale is very rare. The ﬁrst chloroquine-resistant P. malariae has been reported\\n(Malaysia, 2002).\\nResistance also developed against other drugs, including Fansidar®. The situation is evolving rapidly\\nand is a serious threat to the future use of the artemisinins. The highest resistance against anti-\\nmalarial drugs is found in some regions in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, the Thailand-\\nCambodia border and the Thailand-Myanmar border. It is only a question of time before these\\nresistant strains spread further geographically. There are several reasons for this increasing\\nresistance. Important factors include inadequate individual patient compliance, treatments that are\\noften discontinued prematurely, frequent underdosing, earlier mass-treatment campaigns reaching\\nonly part of the population and therapy being sometimes only partly administered, as well as the use\\nof chloroquinated salt [Cambodia, Brazil (the Pinotti method)]. Among the causes of the swift increase\\nin geographical spread are the large-scale migrations of today, and the ability to move rapidly from\\nplace to place. Some products are eliminated slowly from the body (e.g. meﬂoquine t1/2 = 2 weeks)\\nso that for some weeks a subtherapeutic level of the product is present in the body (as what\\nhappened with the addition of choloquine to the salt). When malaria parasites are exposed to such\\nlow concentrations, partially resistant strains have a selective advantage. The occurrence of\\nsubclinical cases (premunition) functions as a source and reservoir for transmission of parasites with\\nreduced sensitivity. Since the cost price of alternative drugs is generally higher than that of traditional\\ntreatments, under-dosing with new drugs will become even more important in future.\\nOn the other hand, reversion of chloroquine resistance has been described in areas where chloroquine'),\n",

It is possible to protect oneself by\\nwearing protective clothing and using an undamaged mosquito net. Eﬀectiveness is increased by\\ntreating the net with pyrethroids (insecticides) such as permethrin (Permas®, Peripel®), lambda-\\ncyhalothrin (Danger®, Demand CS®, Matador®) or deltamethrin (K-Otrine®). This will increase\\nfurther in importance in the future. In most instances, permethrin will be augmented by piperonyl\\nbutoxide. Piperonyl butoxide is the most widely used synthetic pyrethrin synergist and there are no\\nreports available on toxic eﬀects on humans resulting from the exposure to it. Piperonyl butoxide is\\nnot an insecticide itself but a cytochrome P450 inhibitor which allows pyrethroids such as permetrin to\\nbe much more active (10x). Inhibition of the detoxiﬁcation pathway allows higher unchanged systemic\\nconcentrations of the active insecticide to remain within the target animal for a longer period. This is\\nhere now.\\nLong-lasting insecticide treated nets\\nMass produced long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) are replacing older style bed\\nnets. Olyset net was the ﬁrst LLIN which became commercially available. Sumitomo’s\\nOlyset® technology incorporates permetrine insecticide directly into polyethylene ﬁlaments which\\ncan be woven into sturdy bed nets to provide long-lasting protection from night-time biting\\nmosquitoes. Olyset Plus, which received WHO approval in July 2012, retains the controlled-release\\ntechnology and durability, and contains 2% permethrin and 1% of the synergist piperonyl butoxide\\n(PBO). The ﬁbres have been designed to release the two ingredients at a constant ratio of 2:1. The\\n‘bleed rate’ at which permethrin and PBO migrate from the internal reservoir in the ﬁbres to the\\nsurface of the net has been adjusted in order to make the net active again within 1-2 days of\\nwashing. For this work, Sumitomo Chemical became the co-winner of the 2012 ‘Application of Core\\nCompetence’ category – Global Business Coalition Health Award. A major production plant has\\nbeen set up in Tanzania.\\nFine-mesh gauze can be applied to windows and ventilation shafts. One good argument for using a\\nmosquito net is the fact that it also protects from nuisance insects such as Culex mosquitoes and\\nbedbugs.

Parallel computing has become an important subject in the ﬁeld of computer\\nscience and has proven to be critical when researching high performance solutions.\\nThe evolution of computer architectures (multi-core and many-core) towards a higher\\nnumber of cores can only conﬁrm that parallelism is the method of choice for speeding\\nup an algorithm. In the last decade, the graphics processing unit, or GPU, has gained\\nan important place in the ﬁeld of high performance computing (HPC) because of its\\nlow cost and massive parallel processing power. Super-computing has become, for the\\nﬁrst time, available to anyone at the price of a desktop computer. In this paper, we\\nsurvey the concept of parallel computing and especially GPU computing. Achieving\\nefﬁcient parallel algorithms for the GPU is not a trivial task, there are several technical\\nrestrictions that must be satisﬁed in order to achieve the expected performance. Some\\nof these limitations are consequences of the underlying architecture of the GPU and\\nthe theoretical models behind it. Our goal is to present a set of theoretical and techni-\\ncal concepts that are often required to understand the GPU and its massive parallelism\\nmodel. In particular, we show how this new technology can help the ﬁeld of compu-\\ntational physics, especially when the problem is data-parallel. We present four examples\\nof computational physics problems; n-body, collision detection, Potts model and cellular\\nautomata simulations. These examples well represent the kind of problems that are\\nsuitable for GPU computing. By understanding the GPU architecture and its massive\\nparallelism programming model, one can overcome many of the technical limitations\\nfound along the way, design better GPU-based algorithms for computational physics\\nproblems and achieve speedups that can reach up to two orders of magnitude when\\ncompared to sequential implementations.\\nAMS subject classiﬁcations: 68W10, 65Y05, 68Q10, 68N19, 68M14, 00A79, 81Vxx\\n∗Corresponding author.

Furthermore, these problems can become\\neven larger, to the point that not even a multi-core CPU-based algorithm is fast enough.\\nProblems such as these can be found in science and technology; natural sciences [52,\\n108, 116] (Physics, Biology, Chemistry), information technologies [115] (IT), geospatial\\ninformation systems [11,66] (GIS), structural mechanics problems [12] and even abstract\\nmathematical/computer science (CS) problems [84, 98, 101, 109]. Today, many of these\\nproblems can be solved faster and more efﬁciently by using massive parallel processors.\\nThe story of how massive parallel processors were born is actually one of a kind\\nbecause it combines two ﬁelds that were not related at all; computational science and video-\\ngame industry. In science, there is a constant need for solving the largest problems in a\\nreasonable amount of time. This need has led to the construction of massively parallel\\nsuper-computers for understanding phenomena such as galaxy formation, molecular dy-\\nnamics and climate change, among others. On the other hand, the video-game industry\\nis in a constant need for achieving real-time photo-realistic graphics, with the major re-\\nstriction of running their algorithms on consumer-level computer hardware. The need\\nof realistic video-games led to the invention of the graphics accelerator, a small paral-\\nlel processor that handled many graphical computations using hardware implemented\\nfunctions. The two needs, combined together, have given birth to one of the most impor-\\ntant hardware for parallel computing; the GPU.'),\n",

It\\nis not a surprise to see GPU-based algorithms achieve considerable amounts of speedup\\nover a classic CPU-based solution [10,30], even by two orders of magnitude [25,78].\\nSome problems do not have a parallel solution [47]. For example, the approximation\\nof √x using the Newton-Rhapson method [100] cannot be parallelized because each iter-\\nation depends on the value of the previous one; there is the issue of time dependence. Such\\nproblems do not beneﬁt from parallelism at all and are best solved using a CPU. On the\\nother hand, there are problems that can be naturally split into many independent sub-\\nproblems; e.g., matrix multiplication can be split into several independent multiply-add\\ncomputations. Such problems are massively parallel, they are very common in compu-\\ntational physics and they are best solved using a GPU. In some cases, these problems\\nbecome so parallelizable that they receive the name embarrassingly parallel† or pleasingly\\nparallel [87,97].\\nOne of the most important aspects of parallel computing is its close relation to the\\nunderlying hardware and programming models. Typical questions in the ﬁeld are: What\\ntype of problem I am dealing with? Should I use a CPU or a GPU? Is it a MIMD or SIMD\\narchitecture? It is a distributed or shared memory system? What should I use: OpenMP, MPI,\\nCUDA or OpenCL? Why the performance is not what I had expected? Should I use a hierarchical\\npartition? How can I design a parallel algorithm?. These questions are indeed important\\nwhen searching for a high performance solution and their answers lie in the areas of\\nalgorithms, computer architectures, computing models and programming models. GPU\\ncomputing also brings up additional challenges such as manual cache usage, parallel\\nmemory access patterns, communication, thread mapping and synchronization, among\\nothers. These challenges are critical for implementing an efﬁcient GPU algorithm.\\nThis paper is a comprehensive survey of basic and advanced topics that are often\\nrequired to understand parallel computing and especially GPU computing. The main\\ncontribution is the presentation of massive parallel architectures as a useful technology\\nfor solving computational physics problems. As a result, the reader should become more\\nconﬁdent in the fundamental and technical aspects of GPU computing, with a clear idea\\nof what types of problems are best suited for GPU computing.\\nWe organized the rest of the sections in the following way: fundamental concepts\\nof parallel computing and theoretical background are presented ﬁrst, such as basic def-\\ninitions, performance measures, computing models, programming models and architec-\\ntures (from Section 2 to Section 6). Advanced concepts of GPU computing start from\\nSection 7, and cover strategies for designing massive parallel algorithms, the massive\\n†The term embarrassingly parallel means that it would be embarrassing to not take advantage of such paral-\\nlelization. However in some cases, the term has been taken as of being embarrassed to make such paral-\\nlelization; this meaning is unwanted. An alternative name is pleasingly parallel.'),\n",

Both terms are frequently used in the\\nﬁeld of HPC and their difference must be made clear before discussing more advanced\\nconcepts along the survey. The following deﬁnitions of concurrency and parallelism are\\nconsistent and considered correct [14];\\nDeﬁnition 2.1. Concurrency is a property of a program (at design level) where two or\\nmore tasks can be in progress simultaneously.\\nDeﬁnition 2.2. Parallelism is a run-time property where two or more tasks are being\\nexecuted simultaneously.\\nThere is a difference between being in progress and being executed since the ﬁrst one\\ndoes not necessarily involve being in execution. Let C and P be concurrency and par-\\nallelism, respectively, then P ⊂C. In other words, parallelism requires concurrency, but\\nconcurrency does not require parallelism. A nice example where both concepts come into\\nplay is the operating system (OS); it is concurrent by design (performs multi-tasking so\\nthat many tasks are in progress at a given time) and depending on the number of physical\\nprocessing units, these tasks can run parallel or not. With these concepts clear, now we\\ncan make a simple deﬁnition for parallel computing:\\nDeﬁnition 2.3. Parallel computing is the act of solving a problem of size n by dividing\\nits domain into k ≥2 (with k ∈N) parts and solving them with p physical processors,\\nsimultaneously.\\nBeing able to identify the type of problem is essential in the formulation of a parallel\\nalgorithm.

[27]; work and span. Both metrics are important because they give limits to parallel\\ncomputing and introduce the notion of work. Parallel algorithms have the challenge of\\nbeing fast, but also to generate the minimum amount of extra work. By doing less extra\\nwork, they become more efﬁcient.\\nWork is deﬁned as the total time needed to execute a parallel algorithm using one\\nprocessor; denoted as T(n,1). Span is deﬁned as the longest time needed to execute a\\nparallel path of computation by one thread; denoted as T(n,∞). Span is the equivalent of\\nmeasuring time when using an inﬁnite amount of processors.\\nThese two metrics provide lower bounds for T(n,p). The work law equation states the\\nﬁrst lower bound:\\nT(n,p)≥T(n,1)\\np\\n.\\n(3.2)\\nThat is, the running time of a parallel algorithm must be at least 1/p of its work. With the\\nwork law, one can realize that parallel algorithms run faster when the work per processor\\nis balanced.\\nThe span law deﬁnes the second lower bound for T(n,p):\\nT(n,p)≥T(n,∞).\\n(3.3)\\nThis means that the time of a parallel algorithm cannot be lower than the span or the\\nminimal amount of time needed by a processor in an inﬁnite processor machine.\\n3.2\\nSpeedup\\nOne of the most important actions in parallel computing is to actually measure how much\\nfaster a parallel algorithm runs with respect to the best sequential one. This measure is\\nknown as speedup.\\nFor a problem of size n, the expression for speedup is:\\nSp = Ts(n,1)\\nT(n,p) ,\\n(3.4)\\nwhere Ts(n,1) is the time of the best sequential algorithm (i.e., Ts(n,1) ≤T(n,1)) and\\nT(n,p) is the time of the parallel algorithm with p processors, both solving the same\\nproblem. Speedup is upper bounded when n is ﬁxed because of the work law from equa-\\ntion (3.2):\\nSp ≤p.\\n(3.5)\\nIf the speedup increases linearly as a function of p, then we speak of linear speedup. Linear\\nspeedup means that the overhead of the algorithm is always in the same proportion with\\nits running time, for all p. In the particular case of T(n,p) = Ts(n,1)/p, we then speak'),\n",

It is the maximum theoretical value of speedup\\na parallel algorithm can achieve when n is ﬁxed. In practice, it is hard to achieve linear\\nspeedup let alone perfect linear speedup, because memory bottlenecks and overhead\\nincrease as a function of p. What we ﬁnd in practice is that most programs achieve sub-\\nlinear speedup, that is, T(n,p)≥Ts(n,1)/p. Fig. 1 shows the four possible curves.\\nFor the last three decades it has been debated whether super-linear speedup (i.e., Sp>p)\\nis possible or just a fantasy. Super-linear speedup is an important matter in parallel com-\\nputing and proving its existence would beneﬁt computer science, since parallel machines\\nwould be literally more than the sum of their parts (Gustafson’s conclusion in [50]). Smith\\n[110] and Faber et al. [35] state that it is not possible to achieve super-linear speedup and\\nif such a parallel algorithm existed, then a single-core computation of the same algorithm\\nwould be no less than p times slower (leading to linear speedup again). On the opposite\\nside, Parkinson’s work [99] on parallel efﬁciency proposes that super-linear speedup is\\nsometimes possible because the single processor has loop overhead. Gustafson supports\\nsuper-linear speedup and considers a more general deﬁnition of Sp, one as the ratio of\\nspeeds (speed= work/time) [50] and not the ratio of times as in Eq. (3.4). Gustafson con-\\ncludes that the deﬁnition of work, its assumption of being constant and the assumption\\nof ﬁxed-size speedup as the only model are the causes for thinking of the impossibility of\\nsuper-linear speedup [51].\\nIt is important to mention that there are three different models of speedup.

The main\\nreason is because memory performance is problem-dependent. Data structures have to\\nbe aligned in simple patterns so that many chunks of data are read or written simultane-\\nously with minimal hardware cost. Irregular data accesses, alignments and different data\\nchunk sizes result in lower memory bandwidth. Latest GPU architectures such as Fermi\\nand Kepler can mitigate this effect by using an L2 cache for global memory (see [29, 92]\\nfor more information on the GPU’s L2 cache).\\nAll performance measures depend on the running time T(n,p) of the parallel algo-\\nrithm.

The p parameter does\\nnot need to be a constant number, it can also be deﬁned as a function of the problem size\\nn. Each r/w (read/write) operation costs O(1). Different variations of the model exist in\\norder to make it more realistic when modeling parallel algorithms. These variations spec-\\nify whether memory access can be performed concurrently or exclusively. Four variants of\\nthe model exist.\\nEREW, or Exclusive Read – Exclusive Write, is a variant of PRAM where all read an\\nwrite operations are performed exclusively in different places of memory for each pro-\\ncessor. The EREW variation can be used when the problem is split into independent\\ntasks, without requiring any sort of communication. For example, vector addition as\\nwell as matrix addition can be done with an EREW algorithm.\\nCREW, or Concurrent Read – Exclusive Write, is a variant of PRAM where processors\\ncan read from common sections of memory but always write to sections exclusive to\\none another. CREW algorithms are useful for problems based on tilings, where each site\\ncomputation requires information from neighbor sites. Let k be the number of neighbors\\nper site, then each site will perform at least k reads and one write operation. At the same\\ntime, each neighbor site will perform the same number of memory reads and writes.\\nIn the end, each site is read concurrently by k other sites but only modiﬁed once. This\\nbehavior is the main idea of a CREW algorithm. Algorithms for ﬂuid dynamics, cellular\\nautomata, PDEs and N-body simulations are compatible with the CREW variation.\\nERCW, or Exclusive Read – Concurrent Write, is a variant of PRAM where processors\\nread from different exclusive sections of memory but write to shared locations.

He proposed an on-chip architecture based on PRAM [120] as well as the notion\\nof explicit Multi-threading for achieving efﬁcient implementations of PRAM algorithms\\n[121].\\n4.2\\nParallel Memory Hierarchy (PMH)\\nThe Parallel Memory Hierarchy model, or PMH, was proposed in 1993 by Alpern et al. [4]\\nand inspired by related works [2,3] (HMM and UHM memory models). This model was\\nproposed to deal with the problems of PRAM regarding constant time memory opera-\\ntions. Actual CPUs (such as Intel Xeon E5 series or AMD’s Opteron 6000 series) have\\nmemory hierarchies composed of registers, L1, L2 and L3 caches. GPUs such as Nvidia\\nGTX 680 or AMD’s Radeon HD 7850 also have a memory hierarchy composed of reg-\\nisters, L1, L2 caches and the global memory. Indeed, the memory hierarchy should be\\nconsidered when designing a parallel algorithm in order to match the theoretical com-\\nplexity bounds.\\nThe PMH model is deﬁned by a hierarchical tree of memory modules. The leaves\\nof the tree correspond to processors and the internal nodes represent memory modules.\\nModules closer to the processors are fast, but small, and modules far from the processors\\nare slow, but larger. For the i-th level module, the following parameters are deﬁned; si as\\nthe number of items per block (or blocksize), ni the number of blocks, li the latency and\\nci is the child-count. In practice, it is easier to model an algorithm by using the uniform\\nparallel memory hierarchy (UPMH) which is a simpliﬁed version of the PMH model. The\\nUPMH model deﬁnes a complete τ-ary tree (see Fig. 4).\\nIn UPMH, composite parameters are used, such as the aspect ratio α=ni/si, the pack-\\ning factor ρ=si/si−1 and the branching factor τ which is the tree arity. Additionally, the\\nUPMH model deﬁnes the transfer cost ti as a function of the tree level; ti = f(i). Typical\\nvalues of the transfer cost function are f(i)=1,i,ρi. Function f(i)=ρi is considered a re-\\nalistic transfer cost function for modern architectures. Usually, the model is referred to as\\nUPMHα,ρ, f (i),τ to indicate its four parameters. This model has proven to be more realistic\\nthan PRAM, but harder for analyzing algorithms.\\nAlpern et al. showed that an unblocked matrix multiplication algorithm (i.e., the basic\\nmatrix multiplication algorithm) can cost Ω(N5/p) time instead of O(N3/p) [13] as in'),\n",

This programming model works naturally with the PRAM computing\\nmodel and it is mostly useful for multi-core and GPU based solutions. A well known API\\nfor CPUs is the Open Multiprocessing interface or OpenMP [18] which is based on the Unix\\npthreads implementation [90]. In the case of GPUs, OpenCL [65] and CUDA [93] are the\\nmost common.\\nMany times, a shared memory parallel algorithm needs to manage non-deterministic\\nbehavior from multiple concurrent threads (the operating system thread scheduling is\\nconsidered non-deterministic). When concurrent threads read and write on the same\\nmemory locations, one must supply an explicit synchronization and control mechanism\\nsuch as monitors [54], semaphores [34], atomic operations and mutexes (a binary semaphore).\\nThese control primitives allow threads to lock and work on shared resources without\\nother threads interfering, making the algorithm consistent. In some scenarios the pro-\\ngrammer must also be aware of the shared memory consistency model. These models deﬁne\\nrules and the strategy used to maintain consistency on shared memory. A detailed expla-\\nnation of consistency models is available in Adve et al. work [1].\\nFor the case of GPUs, one can use atomic operations, synchronization barriers and\\nmemory fences [93].\\n5.2\\nMessage passing\\nIn a message passing programming model, or distributed model, processors commu-\\nnicate asynchronously or synchronously by sending and receiving messages containing\\nwords of data. In this model, emphasis is placed on communication and synchronization\\nmaking distributed computing the main application for the model. Dijkstra introduced\\nmany new ideas for consistent concurrency on distributed systems based on exclusion\\nmechanisms [33]. This programming model works naturally with the BSP and LogP\\nmodels which were built with the same paradigm.\\nThe standard interface for message passing is the Message Passing Interface or MPI [41].\\nMPI is used for handling communication in CPU distributed applications and is also used\\nto distribute the work when using multiple GPUs.\\n5.3\\nImplicit\\nImplicit parallelism refers to compilers or high-level tools that are capable of achieving\\na degree of parallelism automatically from a sequential piece of source code. The ad-\\nvantage of implicit parallelism is that all the hard work is done by the tool or compiler,\\nachieving practically the same performance as a manual parallelization. The disadvan-\\ntage however is that it only works for simple problems such as for loops with indepen-\\ndent iterations. Kim et al. [68] describe the structure of a compiler capable of implicit\\nand explicit parallelism. In their work, the authors address the two main problems for'),\n",

Func-\\ntional languages such as Haskell or Racket also beneﬁt from the parallel map-reduce\\nmodel. In the 90’s, High performance Fortran (HPF) [77] was a famous parallel implicit\\nAPI. OpenMP can also be considered semi-implicit since its parallelism is based on hints\\ngiven by the programmer. Today, pH (parallel Haskell) is probably the ﬁrst fully implicit\\nparallel programming language [91]. Automatic parallelization is hard to achieve for al-\\ngorithms not based on simple loops and has become a research topic in the last twenty\\nyears [48,74,79,105].\\n5.4\\nAlgorithmic skeletons\\nAlgorithm skeletons provide an important abstraction layer for implementing a parallel\\nalgorithm. With this abstraction, the programmer can now focus more on the strategy\\nof the algorithm rather than on the technical problems regarding parallel programming.\\nAlgorithm skeletons, also known as parallelism patterns, were proposed by Cole in 1989\\nand published in 1991 [24]. This model is based on a set of available parallel comput-\\ning patterns known as skeletons (implemented as higher order functions to receive other\\nfunctions) that are available to use. The critical step when using algorithmic skeletons is\\nto choose the right pattern for a given problem. The following patterns are some of the\\nmost important for parallel computing:\\n• Farm: or parallel map, is a master-slave pattern where a function f() is replicated to\\nmany slaves so that slave si applies f(xi) to sub-problem xi;\\n• Pipeline: or function decomposition, is a staged pattern where f()1−> f()2−>···−>\\nf()n are parts of a bigger logic that works as a pipeline. Each stage of the pipeline\\ncan work in parallel;\\n• Parallel tasks: In this pattern, f()1, f()2,···, f()n are different tasks to be performed\\nin parallel. These tasks can run completely independent or can include critical sec-\\ntions;\\n• Divide and Conquer: This is a recursive pattern where a problem A, a divide\\nfunction d : A →{a1,a2,···,ak} and a combine function c : {a1,a2,···,ak}, f() →\\nf({a1,a2,···,ak}) are passed as parameters for the skeleton. Then the skeleton ap-\\nplies a divide and conquer approach spanning parallel branches of computation as\\nthe recursion tree grows.\\nr(A,d,c, f)=c({r(d(A)1,d,c),r(d(A)2,d,c),···,r(d(A)k,d,c)}, f),\\n(5.1)\\nr(A′,d,c, f)=c(d(A′), f).\\n(5.2)\\nThe recursion stops when the smallest sub-problems d(A′) are reached.'),\n",

Normally, a computer architecture is well de-\\nscribed by one or two computing models. It is important to say that the goal of computer\\narchitectures is not to implement an existing computing model. In fact, it is the other\\nway around; computing models try to model actual computer architectures. The ﬁnal\\ngoal of a computer architecture is to make a computer run programs efﬁciently and as\\nfast as possible. In the past, implementations achieved higher performance automati-\\ncally because the hardware industry increased the processor’s frequency. At that time\\nthere were not many changes regarding the architecture. Now, computer architectures\\nhave evolved into parallel machines because the single core clock speed has reached its\\nlimit in frequency∥[104]. Today the most important architectures are the multi-core and\\nmany-core, represented by the CPU and GPU, respectively.\\nUnfortunately, sequential implementations will no longer run faster by just buying\\nbetter hardware. They must be re-designed as a parallel algorithm that can scale its per-\\nformance as more processors are available. Aspects such as the type of instruction/data\\nstreams, memory organization and processor communication indeed help for achieving\\na better implementation.\\n6.1\\nFlynn’s taxonomy\\nComputer architectures can be classiﬁed by using Flynn’s taxonomy [38]. Flynn realized\\nthat all architectures can be classiﬁed into four categories. This classiﬁcation depends on\\ntwo aspects; number of instructions and number of data streams that can be handled in\\nparallel. He ended with four classiﬁcations.\\nSISD, or single instruction single data stream can only perform one instruction to one\\ndata stream at a time. There is no parallelism at all. Old single core CPUs of the 1950s,\\nbased on the original Von Neumann architecture, were all SISD types. Intel processors\\nfrom 8086 to 80486 were also SISD.\\n∥Above 4.0 GHz of frequency, silicon transistors can become too hot for conventional cooling systems.'),\n",

These architectures allow data paral-\\nlelism, which is useful in science for applying a mathematical model to different parts of\\nthe problem domain. Vector computers in the 70’s and 80’s were the ﬁrst to implement\\nthis architecture. Nowadays, GPUs are considered an evolved SIMD architecture because\\nthey work with many SIMD batches simultaneously. SIMD has also been supported on\\nCPUs as instruction sets, such as MMX, 3DNow!, SSE and AVX. These instruction sets\\nallow parallel integer or ﬂoating point operations over small arrays of data.\\nMISD, or multiple instruction single data stream can handle different tasks over the\\nsame stream of data. These architectures are not so common and often end up being\\nimplemented for speciﬁc scenarios such as digital attack systems (e.g., to destroy a data\\nencryption) or fault tolerance systems and space ﬂight controllers (NASA).\\nMIMD, or multiple instruction multiple data streams is the most ﬂexible architec-\\nture. It can handle one different instruction for each data stream and can achieve any\\ntype of parallelism. However, the complexity of the physical implementation is high and\\noften the overhead involved in handling such different tasks and data streams becomes\\na problem when trying to scale with the number of cores. Modern CPUs fall into this\\ncategory (Intel, AMD and ARM multi-cores) and newer GPU architectures are partially\\nimplementing this architecture. The MIMD concept can be divided into SPMD (single\\nprogram multiple data) and MPMD (multiple programs multiple data). SPMD occurs\\nwhen a simple program is being executed in different processors. The key difference\\ncompared to SIMD is that in SPMD each processor can be at a different stage of the exe-\\ncution or at different paths of the code caused by conditional branching. MPMD occurs\\nwhen different independent programs are being run on multiple processors.\\n6.2\\nMemory architectures and organizations\\nThere are two forms of memory organization, shared and distributed. In distributed\\nmemory, each node has its own memory architecture and it is completely independent\\nfrom other nodes. Communication is based on messages between nodes through a net-\\nwork. In a distributed memory scenario, the network plays a important role and its\\ntopology is different depending on the context. Some common topologies are bus, star,\\nring, mesh, hypercube and tree. Also, hybrid topologies are made based on the basic ones\\nalready mentioned.\\nIn a shared memory organization, processors communicate through a common bank\\nof global memory, not needing explicit messages as in a distributed memory scheme.\\nToday, two architectures are mostly used; UMA and NUMA.\\nUniform Memory Access or UMA consists of a shared memory in which the access\\ntime for any processor takes the same amount of time no matter the data location. UMA\\nis also known as Symmetric Multi-Processors or SMP. The main disadvantage of UMA is\\nthe low scalability when increasing the number of processors. This occurs because of the\\nsingle memory controller shared for all processors.'),\n",

Most of their die surface is reserved for control units and cache, leaving a\\nsmall area for the numerical computations. The reason is, a CPU performs such different\\ntasks that having advanced cache and control mechanisms is the only way to achieve an\\noverall good performance.\\nOn the other hand, the GPU has a SIMD-based architecture that can be well repre-\\nsented by the PRAM and UPMH models (Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively). The main\\ngoal of a GPU architecture is to achieve high performance through massive parallelism.\\nContrary to the CPU, the die surface of the GPU is mostly occupied by ALUs and a min-\\nimal region is reserved for control and cache (see Fig. 12). Efﬁcient algorithms designed\\nfor GPUs have reported up to 100x speedup over CPU implementations [25,78].\\nFigure 12: The GPU architecture diﬀers from the one of the CPU because its layout is dedicated for placing\\nmany small cores, giving little space for control and cache units.\\nThis difference in architecture has a direct consequence, the GPU is much more restric-\\ntive than the CPU but it is much more powerful if the solution is carefully designed for\\nit. Latest GPU architectures such as Nvidia’s Fermi and Kepler have added a signiﬁcant\\ndegree of ﬂexibility by incorporating a L2 cache for handling irregular memory accesses\\nand by improving the performance of atomic operations. However, this ﬂexibility is still\\nfar from the one found in CPUs.\\nIndeed there is a trade-off between ﬂexibility and computing power.

In fact, it is considered an art [70,95] that\\ninvolves a combination of mathematical background, creativity, discipline, passion and\\nprobably other unclassiﬁable abilities. In parallel computing the scenario is no different,\\nthere is no golden rule for designing perfect parallel algorithms.\\nThere are some formal strategies that are frequently used for creating efﬁcient parallel\\nalgorithms. Leighton and Thomson [76] have contributed considerably to the ﬁeld by\\npointing out how data structures, architectures and algorithms relate when facing the act\\nof implementing a parallel algorithm. In 1995, Foster [40] identiﬁed a four-step strategy\\nthat is present in many well designed parallel algorithms; partitioning, communication,\\nagglomeration and mapping (see Fig. 13).\\n7.1\\nPartitioning\\nThe ﬁrst step when designing a parallel algorithm is to split the problem into parallel sub-\\nproblems. In partitioning, the goal is to ﬁnd the best partition possible; one that generates\\nthe highest amount of sub-problems (at this point, communication is not considered yet).\\nIdentifying the domain type is critical for achieving a good partition of a problem. If\\nthe problem is data-parallel, then the data is partitioned and we speak of data parallelism.\\nOn the other hand, if the problem is task-parallel, then the functionality is partitioned and\\nwe speak of task-parallelism. Most of the computational physics problems based on\\nsimulations are suitable for a data-parallelism approach, while problems such as parallel\\ngraph traverse, communication ﬂows, trafﬁc management, security and fault tolerance\\noften fall into the task-parallelism approach.\\n7.2\\nCommunication\\nAfter partitioning, communication is deﬁned between the sub-problems (task or data\\ntype). There are two types of communication; local communication and global communica-\\ntion. In local communication, sub-problems communicate with neighbors using a certain\\ngeometric or functional pattern. Global communications involve broadcast, reductions or\\nglobal variables. In this phase, all types of communication problems are handled; from\\nrace conditions handled by critical sections or atomic operations, to synchronization bar-\\nriers to ensure that the strategy of computation is working up to this point.\\n7.3\\nAgglomeration\\nAt this point, there is a chance that sub-problems may not generate enough work to\\nbecome a thread of computation (given a computer architecture).

The goal of GPU comput-\\ning is to achieve the highest performance for data-parallel problems through a massive\\nparallel algorithm that is run on the GPU.\\nGPU computing started as a research ﬁeld for computer graphics (CG) in the early\\n2000s and gained high importance as a general purpose parallel processor [80]. In 2001,\\nfor the ﬁrst time the graphics processing unit was built upon a programmable architec-\\nture, permitting programmable lighting [22, 64, 67], shadow [23] and geometry [107] ef-\\nfects to be computed and rendered in real-time. These effects were achieved using a high\\nlevel shading language such as GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) [83], HLSL (High-\\nlevel Shading Language) [94] and CG (C for Graphics) [82]. At that time, the massive\\nparallelism paradigm was already in the minds of the CG researchers who were design-\\ning per-vertex and per-fragment algorithms to work in a set of millions of primitives. As\\nthe years passed, the scientiﬁc community became interested in the power of GPUs and\\nits low cost compared to other solutions (clusters, super-computers). However, adapting\\na scientiﬁc problem to a graphics environment was hard and challenging from the tech-\\nnical side. In the early days, the act of adapting different kinds of problems to the GPU\\nwas considered as hacking the GPU.\\nIn 2002, McCool et al. published a paper detailing a meta-programming GPGPU lan-\\nguage, named Sh [85]. In 2004, Buck et al. proposed Brook for GPUs, also known as\\nBrook-GPU [15]. This was an extension of the C language that allowed general purpose\\nprogramming on programmable GPUs. Both Sh and Brook-GPU played a fundamental\\nrole in expanding the idea of GPU computing by hiding the graphical context of shading\\nlanguages.\\nIn the year 2006 another general purpose GPU computing API was released. This time\\nby Nvidia and named CUDA (Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture) [93]. Technically,\\nthe CUDA API is an extension of the C language and compiles general purpose code to\\nbe executed on the GPU (based on the shared memory programming model). The release\\nof CUDA became an important milestone in the history of GPU computing because it\\nwas the ﬁrst API that offered effective documentation for getting started in the ﬁeld. The\\nCUDA acronym refers to the general purpose architecture of Nvidia’s GPUs [29], suitable\\nfor GPU computing. At the moment, only Nvidia GPUs support CUDA.\\nIn the year 2008, an open standard was released with the name of OpenCL (Open\\nComputing Language), allowing the creation of multi-platform, massively parallel code\\n[65]. Its programming model is similar to that of CUDA but uses different names for the\\nsame structures. The programming model behind CUDA and OpenCL is a key aspect for\\nGPU computing because it deﬁnes several components that are essential for implement-\\ning a massively parallel algorithm.\\n8.1\\nThe massive parallelism programming model\\nThe programming models explained in Section 5 are necessary but not sufﬁcient for un-\\nderstanding the programming model of the GPU.

This section covers these aspects.\\nThe GPU programming model is characterized by its high level of parallelism, thus\\nthe name Massive parallelism programming model. This model is an abstract layer that lies\\non top of the GPU’s architecture. It allows the design of massive parallel algorithms\\nindependent of how many physical processing units are available or how execution order\\nof threads is scheduled.\\nThe abstraction is achieved by the space of computation, deﬁned as a discrete space\\nwhere a massive amount of threads are organized. In CUDA, the space of computation\\nis composed of a grid, blocks and threads. For OpenCL, it is work-space, work-group and\\nwork-item, respectively. A grid is a discrete k-dimensional (with k=1,2,3) box type struc-\\nture that deﬁnes the size and volume of the space of computation. Each element of the\\ngrid is a block. Blocks are smaller k′-dimensional (with k′ = 1,2,3) structures identiﬁed\\nby their coordinate relative to the grid. Each block contains many spatially organized\\nthreads. Finally, each thread has a coordinate relative to the block for which it belongs.\\nThis coordinate system characterizes the space of computation and serves to map the\\nthreads to the different locations of the problem. Fig. 14 illustrates an example of two-\\ndimensional space of computation. Each block has access to a small local memory, in\\nCUDA it is known as the shared memory (in OpenCL it is known just as the local memory).\\nIn practical terms, the shared memory works as a manual cache. It is important to make\\ngood use of this fast memory in order to achieve peak performance of the GPU.\\nFigure 14: Massive parallelism programming model presented as a 2D model including grid, blocks and threads.\\nImage inspired from Nvidia’s CUDA C programming guide [93].\\nThe programming work-ﬂow of GPU computing is viewed as a host-device relation-\\nship between the CPU and GPU, respectively. A host program (e.g., a C program) uploads\\nthe problem into the device (GPU memory), and then invokes a kernel (a function written\\nto run on the GPU) passing as parameter the grid and block size. The host program can\\nwork in a synchronous or asynchronous manner, depending if the result from the GPU is\\nneeded for the next step of computation or not. When the kernel has ﬁnished in the GPU,\\nthe result data is copied back from device to host. Fig. 15 summarizes the work-ﬂow.'),\n",

For AMD GPUs,\\nthese groups are known as wavefronts and its size is 64 threads for their actual GCN\\n(graphics core next) architecture. For Nvidia GPUs, these groups are known as warps\\nand the actual architectures such as Fermi and Kepler work with a size of 32 threads. The\\nOpenCL standard uses a more descriptive name; SIMD width. For simplicity reasons, we\\nwill refer to these groups as warps.\\nBoth AMD’s and Nvidia’s GPUs support some degree of concurrency for handling\\nthe entire space of computation. Most of the time, there will be more threads than what\\ncan really be processed in parallel. While all threads are in progress (concurrency), only\\na subset are really working in parallel. The maximum number of parallel threads run-\\nning on a GPU normally corresponds to the number of processing units. However, the\\nmaximum number of concurrent threads is much higher. For example, the Geforce GTX\\n580 GPU can process up to 512 threads in parallel, but can handle up to 24,576 concur-\\nrent threads. For most problems, it is recommended to overﬂow the parallel computing\\ncapacity. The reason is that the GPU’s thread scheduler is smart enough to switch idle\\nwarps (i.e., warps that are waiting a memory access or a special function unit result, such\\nas sqrt()) with new ones ready for computation. In other words, there is a small pipeline\\nof numerical computation and memory accesses that the scheduler tries to maintain busy\\nall the time.\\n8.3\\nTechnical considerations for a GPU implementation\\nThe GPU computing community frequently uses the terms coalesced memory, thread coars-\\nening, padding and branching.

Many algorithms require irregular access pat-\\nterns with crossed relations between the chunks of data and threads. These algorithms\\nare the hardest to optimize for the GPU and are considered great challenges in HPC re-\\nsearch [95].\\nThread coarsening is the act of reducing the ﬁne-grained scheme used on a solution\\nby increasing the work per thread. As a result, the amount of registers per block increases\\nallowing to re-use more computations saved on the registers. Choosing the right amount\\nof work per thread normally requires some experimental tuning.\\nPadding is the act of adjusting the problem size on each dimension, nd, into one that\\nis multiple of the block size; n′\\nd = ρ⌈nd/ρ⌉(where ρ is the number of threads per block\\nper dimension) so that now the problem ﬁts tightly in the grid (the block size per dimen-\\nsion is a multiple of the warp size). An important requirement is that the extra dummy\\ndata must not affect the original result. With padding, one can avoid putting conditional\\nstatements in the kernel that would lead to unnecessary branching.\\nBranching is an effect caused when conditional statements in the kernel code lead to\\nsequential execution of the if and else parts. It has a negative impact in performance and\\nshould be avoided whenever possible. The reason why branching occurs is because all\\nthreads within a warp execute in a lock-step mode and will run completely in parallel\\nonly if they follow the same execution path in the kernel code (SIMD computation). If\\nany conditional statement breaks the execution into two or more paths, then the paths\\nare executed sequentially. Conditionals can be safely used if one can guarantee that the\\nprogram will follow the same execution path for a whole warp. Additionally, tricks such\\nas clamp, min, max, module and bit-shifts are hardware implemented, cause no branching\\nand can be used to evade simple conditionals.\\n9\\nExamples of spatial and tiled GPU compatible problems\\nThe last three sections have covered different aspects of parallel computing with spe-\\ncial emphasis on GPU computing. In several instances we have mentioned that compu-\\ntational physics is a ﬁeld that can beneﬁt greatly from GPU-based algorithms because\\nmany of its problems are data-parallel.

The trick is to save the result-\\ning positions in a different array so that no synchronization is needed. The naive solution\\nto this problem requires a O(n2) algorithm; for each particle, sum up the contributions\\nof the other n−1. A GPU solution for this algorithm can indeed be achieved by splitting\\nthe problem domain into one job per particle; resulting in a O( n2\\np ) algorithm (where p\\nis the amount of parallelism provided by the GPU). The book GPU Gems 3 includes a\\nchapter for the GPU-based implementation of the O(n2) algorithm [89]. But GPU algo-\\nrithms should not stop on the simplest parallelization. As with the sequential case, GPU\\nalgorithms can also improve by using more advanced data-structures such as trees.\\nA faster hierarchical algorithm can be achieved by sacriﬁcing some numerical preci-\\nsion. In Eq. (9.1), one can see that the contributions of the summation decrease quadrat-\\nically as the distance from qk to qi increases. As a result, particles very far from qi will\\nmake no signiﬁcant contribution to Fi. On the other hand, particles close to qi will make\\nmost of the contribution. This analysis on the signiﬁcance of contributions as a function\\nof distance is the key for designing a faster n-body algorithm.\\nThe Barnes-Hut tree-code algorithm [6] is a well known spatial partitioning solution\\nthat achieves O(nlogk n) average time per time step. It uses a 2k-tree known as quad-\\ntree for k = 2 and oct-tree for k = 3. The tree data-structure is used for storing average\\nmeasures for cluster of points far from the reference point. The bigger the distance from\\nthe reference point, the bigger the cluster (See Fig. 16). The algorithm works as follows;\\neach internal node of the tree structure contains k children, its position to the center of the\\nsub-space contained and an average measure of the contained particles.

Instead, Monte Carlo\\nbased simulations are often used because of their polynomial time.\\nThere most popular Monte Carlo algorithm for the Potts model is the Metropolis algo-\\nrithm [86]. The main idea is that each spin uses only neighborhood information (no global\\ndata), making each computation independent and fully parallelizable. The Metropolis\\nalgorithm is relevant for GPU computing because it introduces the concept of stencil com-\\nputation.

Komura et al. have proposed GPU based versions of such\\nalgorithms [71,72].\\n9.4\\nCellular Automata simulation\\nCellular Automata (CA) were ﬁrst formulated by the hands of John Von Neumann, Kon-\\nrad Zuse and Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s (see [88, 122]). CA are important for GPU\\ncomputing because they are inherently data-parallel dynamic systems based on stencil\\ncomputations. CA are used for the simulation of galaxy formation, typhoon propagation,\\nﬂuid dynamics [61,118], biological dynamics [45], social interactions, and theoretical par-\\nallel machines. In general, it can simulate any problem that can be reduced to a system\\nof cells interacting under a local rule. It has been proven that even the simplest CA are\\ncapable of being Turing complete machines [26].\\nCA are deﬁned as a dynamical discrete space, where each cell ct\\ni has one of k possible\\nstates at time t. The computation of the next state ct+1\\ni\\nis given by:\\nct+1\\ni\\n= f(<ci >t),\\n(9.5)\\nwhere f(< ci >t) is the local transition function or local rule applied to the neighborhood\\n< ci >. The challenge of CA research is to discover new rules that could simulate events\\nof our universe and help in the quest of understanding how complex and chaotic systems\\nwork.\\nIn a CA simulation, every cell can compute its next state for time step t+1 indepen-\\ndently by only using the information from its neighborhood (including itself) in time step\\nt. It is important to note that along the simulation, some cells are in quiescent state, which\\nmeans that they will remain in that same state as long as the neighborhood is in quiescent\\nstate too (in some CA this is considered as the ”dead” state).\\nA simple parallel algorithm can assign p processors to the n different automatons\\nand perform one step of simulation in a theoretical time of O( n\\np) under the PRAM model\\nusing the CREW variation. In the ideal case, with p≈n, one step of evolution would take\\nO(1) time. Fig. 19 shows a time-space evolution of a known one-dimensional CA, the\\nrule 161, as well as a snapshot of John Conway’s game of life [42] in its present state. Both\\nimages were taken from a GPU application implemented by the authors.\\nAn efﬁcient algorithm is one that only processes non-quiescent cells, otherwise there\\nis a substantial waste of computation per time step. Processing b non-quiescent cells\\nwith p processors is at least Ω(b/p). In many CA, space is much bigger than the number\\nof non-quiescent cells, therefore b ≪n. For these cases, the space can be treated as a\\ndimensional sparse matrix. However, adapting such a strategy for a massive parallel\\nsolution is not simple and problems such as access patterns and neighbor data layout\\nmust be solved.\\nRelated work has been focused on solving the main challenges for efﬁcient GPU im-\\nplementations and comparing performance against multicore solutions (CPU) [59, 106].'),\n",

Another interesting topic is to efﬁciently simulate CA working in other topolo-\\ngies such as hexagonal or triangular [8,43] where the GPU’s space of computation does not\\nmatch exactly with the problem domain. Furthermore, doing CA simulations on non-\\nEuclidean topologies is an even more complex problem [130].\\n10\\nLatest advances and open problems in GPU computing\\nIn the ﬁeld of computational physics, O(n) cost algorithms (the fast multi-pole expan-\\nsion method [127–129]) have been implemented on GPU for n-body simulations. Single\\nGPU implementations have been proposed for achieving high performance Potts model\\nsimulations [116, 117] even with biological applications [20]. Multi-GPU based imple-\\nmentations have also been proposed for the Potts model [72] and for n-body simula-\\ntions [126]. In a multi-GPU scenario, two levels of parallelism are used; distributed and\\nlocal. Distributed parallelism is in charge of doing a coarse grained partition of the prob-\\nlem, the mapping of sub-problems to computer nodes and the communication across the\\nsuper-computer or cluster. Local parallelism is in charge of solving a sub-problem inde-\\npendently with a single GPU. Multi-GPU based algorithms have the advantage of com-\\nputing solutions to large scale problems that cannot ﬁt in a single machine’s memory. The\\nmain challenge for multi-GPU methods is to achieve efﬁcient distributed parallelism (e.g.,\\nhiding data communication cost by overlapping communication with computation).\\nCellular Automata are now being used as a model for fast parallel simulation of phys-\\nical phenomena, trafﬁc simulation and image segmentation, among others [36,44,63,73].\\nIn the ﬁeld of computer graphics, new algorithms have been proposed for building kd-\\ntrees or oct-trees in GPU to achieve real-time ray-tracing [56,62,131] as well as real-time\\nmethods for 3D reconstruction and level set segmentation [46, 103]. The ﬁeld of pro-\\ngramming languages have contributed to parallel computing by proposed high level\\nparallel languages for the programmer (i.e., to abstract the programmer so that the job\\nof partitioning, communication, agglomeration and mapping is part of the compiler or\\nframework [17, 112]).

In a more theoretical level, a new GPU-based com-\\nputational model has also been proposed; the K-model [16] which serves for analyzing\\nGPU-based algorithms.\\nArchitectural advances in parallel computing have focused on combining the best of\\nthe CPU and GPU worlds. Parallel GPU architectures are now making possible massive\\nparallelism by using thousands of cores, but also with ﬂexible work-ﬂows, access pat-\\nterns and efﬁcient cache predictions. The latest GPU architectures have included dynamic\\nparallelism [29]; a feature that consists of making it possible for the GPU to schedule addi-\\ntional work for itself by using a command processor, without needing to send data back and\\nforth between host and device. This means that recursive hierarchical partition of the do-\\nmain will be possible on the ﬂy, without needing the CPU to control each step. Lastly, one\\nof the most important revolutions in computer architecture (affecting parallel computing\\ndirectly) is the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) [114] project. HMC is a three-dimensional\\nmemory architecture that promises 15× better performance than DDR3 memory, requir-\\ning 70% less energy per bit.\\nThere are still open problems for GPU computing. Most of them exist because of the\\nactual limitations of the massive parallelism model. In a parallel SIMD architecture, some\\ndata structures do not work so well. Tree implementations have been solved partially for\\nthe GPU, but data structures such as classic dynamic arrays, heaps, hash tables and complex\\ngraphs are not performance-friendly yet and need research for efﬁcient GPU usage. An-\\nother problem is the fact that some sequential algorithms are so complex that porting\\nthem to a parallel version will lead to no improvement at all. In these cases, a complete\\nredesign of the algorithm must be done. The last open problem we have identiﬁed is\\nthe act of mapping the space of computation (i.e., the grid of blocks) to different kinds\\nof problem domains (i.e., geometries). A naive space of computation can always build\\na bounding box around the domain and discard the non useful blocks of computation.\\nNon Euclidean geometry is a special case that illustrates this problem; ﬁnding an efﬁcient\\nmap for each block of the grid to the fractal problem domain is not trivial. The only way\\nof solving this problem is to ﬁnd an efﬁcient mapping function from the space of compu-\\ntation to the problem domain, or modify the problem domain so that it becomes similar\\nto an Euclidean box. With dynamic parallelism, it will be possible for the ﬁrst time to build\\nfractal spaces of computation for non-Euclidean problems, increasing efﬁciency.\\n11\\nDiscussion\\nOver the past 40 years, parallel computing has evolved signiﬁcantly from being a mat-\\nter of high equipped data centers and supercomputers to almost every electronic device\\nthat uses a CPU or GPU. Today, the ﬁeld of parallel computing is having one of its best\\nmoments in history of computing and its importance will only grow as long as computer\\narchitectures keep evolving to a higher number of processors.

However, to achieve such desired levels of performance, implemen-\\ntations need to be aware of the underlying architecture. The PRAM model is one of the\\nmost popular theoretical models but it lacks the considerations of the different memory\\nhierarchies that are present in every computer architecture today. When using the shared\\nmemory programming model, it is important to combine the PMH and PRAM model so\\nthat the implementation behaves like the theoretical bounds. The BSP and LogP mod-\\nels are useful when designing distributed algorithms where communication is a critical\\naspect. As with PMH and PRAM, BSP and LogP can be combined for better modeling\\nof a distributed algorithm. That is, one can include message overheads, gaps and global\\nsynchronization barriers all in one problem.\\nAutomatic parallelization is now supported by some high level languages such as pH.\\nAlso, modern APIs can parallelize loop sections of programs by just adding a directive in\\nthe program code (e.g., OpenMP). This trend will continue to evolve, each time including\\nmore and more patterns to the implicit parallelization programming model so that in the\\nend only complex problems of science and engineering will need manually optimized\\nparallelization.\\nGPU computing is a young branch of parallel computing that is growing each year.\\nPeople from the HPC community have realized that many problems can be solved with\\nenergy-efﬁcient hardware using the massive parallelism paradigm. For some problems,\\nGPU implementations have reported impressive speedups of up to 100x; results accepted\\nby most, though questioned by Lee et. al. [75]. The cost of achieving such extreme perfor-\\nmance is the complex re-design. For some problems, a port from the sequential version\\nis not enough and a re-design of the algorithm is needed in order to use the massive\\nparallel capabilities of the GPU architecture. In general, data-parallel problems are well\\nsuited for a massive parallel execution in GPU; that is, problems where the domain can\\nbe split into several independent sub-problems. The split process can be an arbitrary dis-\\ntribution or a recursive divide and conquer strategy. Time dependent problems with little\\nwork to be done at each time step are not well suited for GPU computing and will lead\\nto inefﬁcient performance. Examples are the computation of small dynamical systems,\\nnumerical series, iterative algorithms with small work per iterations and graph traverse\\nwhen the structure has only a few connections.\\nIt is important to note how the natural-scientiﬁc and human-type problems differ in\\nthe light of parallel computing. Science problems beneﬁt from parallelism by using a\\ndata-parallel approach without sacriﬁcing complexity as a result. This is because many\\nphysical phenomena follow the idea of a dynamic system where simple rules can exhibit\\ncomplex behavior in the long term. On the other side, human-type problems are simi-\\nlar to a complex graph structure with many connections and synchronization problems.\\nSuch level of complexity in communication make parallel algorithms perform slowly.\\nThere is still much work to be done in the ﬁeld of parallel computing. The challenge\\nfor massive parallel architectures in the following years is for them to become more ﬂexi-'),\n",
